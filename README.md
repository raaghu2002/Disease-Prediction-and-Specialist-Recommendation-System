# Disease-Prediction-and-Specialist-Recommendation-System

# Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Disease Prediction and Specialist Recommendation System built using Node.js, Python, and Machine Learning. The main objective of this project is to predict diseases based on user input and recommend specialists and nearby hospitals for the predicted disease. The project leverages a disease dataset from Kaggle and incorporates the Gemini API for specialist and hospital recommendations.

# Features
Disease Prediction: Utilizes a machine learning model to predict possible diseases based on user-provided symptoms.
Specialist Recommendation: Integrates the Gemini API to recommend medical specialists for the predicted disease.
Hospital Locator: Provides a list of hospitals in the user's vicinity for the predicted disease.
User-Friendly Interface: A web-based interface built with Node.js for easy input and result visualization.

#Technologies Used
Node.js: For building the web application and handling the server-side logic.
Python: For implementing the machine learning model.
Machine Learning: Utilized scikit-learn for training the disease prediction model.
Gemini API: For recommending specialists and locating hospitals.
Kaggle Dataset: Used a comprehensive disease dataset from Kaggle for training the model.
